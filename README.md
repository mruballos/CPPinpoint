# CPPinpoint

Our goal is to create an Amazon Pinpoint mobile application that exposes a Web Console and API to manage Pinpoint resources, track app usage and evaluate the performance of push notification campaigns. The primary goal will be to quickly get information on a app trends, segments and campaign performance with a secondary goal of taking action.
